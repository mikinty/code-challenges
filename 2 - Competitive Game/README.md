# Challenge 2 - Competitive Game
Suppose you have an `int` array and you're going to play a 2 player game. 

The game goes as follows:
- player A takes a subset of the array with an odd sum and removes it
- player B then takes a subset of the array with an even sum and removes it
- if either player can't make a move they lose

The question: How do you tell who will win if they both play optimally?

## Program specifications
- __Input__: `int` array
- __Output__: the player that wins
