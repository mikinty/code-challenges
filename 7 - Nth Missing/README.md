# Challenge 7 - Nth Missing

Given an unsorted array of positive integers, find the smallest positive integer that is not in the array.

E.g. Given
```
[5, 3, 9, 1, 4, 2]
```
the smallest positive integer that is not in the array is `6`, because `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` are all in the array.

## Complexities
1. O(n^2) - Easy
2. O(n*log(n)) - Intuitive
3. O(n) - N I C E (_hint_: think about an upper bound on the answer)
