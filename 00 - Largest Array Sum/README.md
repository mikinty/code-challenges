# Challenge 0 - Largest Array Sum
Given an array of integers, find the consecutive block with the __largest__ sum.

For example,
```
[-1, 2, 0, -6, 4, 6, 5, -9, 8, 7, 2],
```
the largest sum would be `23`, with the block being `[4, 6, 5, -9, 8, 7, 2]`.

Your program only has the print out the largest sum, and does not have to worry about printing out the numbers in the block.

## Complexities
1. O(n^2) - Easy
2. O(n*log(n)) - Not bad
3. O(n) - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
