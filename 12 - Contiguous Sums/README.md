# Challenge 12 - Contiguous Sums

Given a target integer `T` and an array of integers

```python
[x1, x2, ..., xn]
```

does there exist some contiguous sum of numbers in this array that
adds up to `T`? Your function should return true or false depending
on whether this sum exists or not.

## Progression

- Try to solve this with O(n^2) time
- Try to solve this with O(n^2) time and O(1) space
- Try to solve this with O(n) time and O(n) space
- Does your function work with negative numbers?
