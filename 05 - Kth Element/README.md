# Challenge 5 - Kth Element

Given an array of integers (not necessarily sorted), find the kth largest element of the array.

Constraints: 1 <= k <= len(n)

e.g. 

```
a = [4, 1, -8, 0, 14, 2]
kth(a, 1) = -8
kth(a, 2) = 0
kth(a, 3) = 1
kth(a, 4) = 1
kth(a, 5) = 1
kth(a, 6) = 14
```

Note: do you have to search through the entire array?

## Complexities
1. O(n^2) - Easy
2. O(n*log(n)) - Not bad
3. Is there better?
