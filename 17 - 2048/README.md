# 2048

The popular viral game from 2014, `2048` is a game where you move tiles with
powers of two, which combine to form the next power of two when merged
together. To see the game in action, see https://play2048.co/.

As always with games, there are varying levels of completeness to implement this game

1. Implement the board and game logic, with user input
2. Keep track of scoring, and conditions for losing and winning
3. Create a UI to show the game
