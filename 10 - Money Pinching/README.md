# Challenge 10 - Money Pinching

Suppose you are at a supermarket, and you have the options to buy

```Python
num = [n_1, n_2, n_3, ..., n_i]
```

apple packs, each with a price of 

```Python
price = [p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_i]
```

You want to maximize the amount of apples you buy with a starting amount of N dollars. What is the maximum number of apples you can buy?

For example, if
```
num = [1, 2]
price = [2, 2]
N = 10
```
The maximum number of apples you can buy is `10`, where you choose to buy 5 2-apple packs.
