## Learning Resources

- [Guide to Competitive Programming: Learning and Improving Algorithms Through Contests](https://amzn.to/3lbdlFV): A very good overview of algorithms that are crucial for solving problems fast and efficiently. If you're interviewing for Quant or Backend roles, this book is a must. If you're younger like a high schooler, this book is gold for studying for USACO or ICPC and other contests, but can be hard without having being exposed to some of the CS contests.
- [System Design Interview â€“ An Insider's Guide](https://amzn.to/3wn8Ywk): A great overview about how to solve system design problems for IC4+ roles in the SWE industry. These are problems that involve creating higher-level designs for large systems such as products like Google Drive, YouTube, tinyurl, etc.
